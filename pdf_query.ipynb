The portal has been designed keeping in view the guidelines for voluntary scheme of the Ministry of Tourism for Project \\napprovals of hotels and classifications of the hotels. Under this portal the applicant firm/hotel has to apply \\non-line with all necessary documents as required under these guidelines, to be uploaded. The portal also \\nprovides facilities to the applicant to track the application once they file it on-line. The whole procedure is on-line except the inspection of the hotel for physical verification of the facilities in the hotel and the documents submitted by it on-line. Since January, 2016 the fee for classification of the hotel which earlier used to be received by way of Demand Drafts, is also now being received via e-payments only viz Debit Cards, Credit Cards and Net Banking. \\nThe number of approved hotels and rooms vary from year to year as the classification/re-classification \\nof hotels is a voluntary scheme of the Ministry of Tourism.

Section 10.1: Summary of the Study on Analysis \\nand Development of Action Plan based on World Economic Forum Ranking System for Travel & Tourism Competitiveness for India and 10.2 Methodology for estimation of domestic and foreign visitors.\\n10.1 r eport on s tudy, analysis and development of a ction Plan based on World Economic \\nForum ranking system for t ravel & t ourism competitiveness for india\\nThe Ministry of Tourism had commissioned Quality Council of India to carry out a research-based action plan based on the World Economic Forum Ranking System for Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index for India (TTCI) to determine the different sectors of economy impacting tourism directly or indirectly and to suggest innovative action plans from Quality Council of India’s professionals that are aimed to strengthen India’s Travel and Tourism sector in near future.\\nThe exercise has resulted in a holistic research for numerous action plans to ameliorate tourism sector \\nof India, which can enable identification of the best practices, gaps and subsequent improvement of our \\ncountry’s ranking in forthcoming TTCI report.\\nWorld Economic Forum (WEF) publishes the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) report \\nbiennially which measures the factors and policies that make a country a viable place to invest within the \\nTravel and Tourism sector, with the aim to create healthy competition in the travel and tourism sector of \\nvarious economies.\\n136 Countries were analysed in 2017 and scored on four sub-indexes: \\n1. Enabling Environment\\n2. T&T Policy and Enabling Conditions\\n3. Infrastructure\\n4. Natural and Cultural Resources\\nThese sub-indexes are composed of 14 pillars which are further bifurcated into 90 indicators of Travel and \\nTourism Competitiveness.\\ncurrent s tate of affairs\\nIndia is one of the nations to exhibit significant improvement, rising by 25 places  from 2013 to reach the \\n40th position globally  in 2017. India continues to charm international tourists with its vast cultural and \\nnatural resources (9th and 24th, respectively), and its price competitiveness advantage (10th). The country continues to enrich its cultural resources, protecting more cultural sites and intangible expressions through UNESCO World Heritage lists, and via a greater digital presence. International openness (55th, up 14 places as compared to 2015), through stronger visa policies achieved by implementing both visas on arrival and e-visas, has enabled India to rise through the ranks.surVEY/studiEsIndia Tourism Statistics, 2019 Survey/Studies150However, health conditions are improving, though they remain inadequate (104th). Similarly, ICT readiness \\n(112th), security concerns (114th) and human resources (87th) are improving, but remain weak. While further improvements are needed across these dimensions, India is taking small but important steps in the right direction. The Indian T&T sector presents significant opportunities that are yet to be tapped, especially in the provision of tourist service infrastructure (110th), and in terms of additional accommodation capacity, entertainment facilities and related services.\\nmethodology\\nThe methodology adopted by QCI in decoding WEF’s TTCI report for suggesting action plans includes \\n1. Studying the framework of the report\\n2. Analysing past 4 editions (2011, 2013, 2015 & 2017) of TTCI report to understand evolution in \\nmethodology\\n3. Analysing trend in change of weightages adopted by WEF over the years\\n4. Identifying countries that could serve as benchmark countries for India based on policy interventions \\nand strategies adopted by such better ranking countries\\n5. Comparing India’s performance with:\\na. Asian peer(s) performing better than India\\nb. Top performing country of the indicator\\nc. Best global practices relevant to the indicator \\nd. India’s major competitors in the indicator.\\nscores of these 14 pillars are calculated based on:\\ni. Data derived from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS), which accounts for 34% of the indicators. \\nWEF’s partner institute for India is Lead Cap Ventures that conducts survey of leading business \\nexecutives from private sector for the EOS and ranges in value from 1 to 7.\\nii. Quantitative data (Hard Data) that constitutes the balance 66% of the indicators. This data is collected from pre-published reports through various sources, which were further normalized on a 1-to-7 scale \\nto align them with the EOS’s results.\\nThe list of the 4 sub-indexes and the 14 identified pillars are as follows:\\nI. Enabling Environment\\n1. Business Environment\\n2. Safety and Security\\n3. Health and Hygiene\\n4. Human Resources and Labour Market\\n5. ICT Readiness\\nII. T&T Policy and Enabling Conditions\\n6.

Air Transport Infrastructure\\n11. Ground and Port Infrastructure\\n12. Tourist Service Infrastructure\\nIV. Natural and Cultural Resources\\n13. Natural Resources\\n14. Cultural Resources and Business Travel\\nAction plan for 90 indicators have been developed, varying from short term to long term plans which require \\nmajor policy interventions, with Experts/former officials with domain knowledge consulted while formulating action plans. \\nOut of the 90 indicators, QCI recommends prioritization of 32 indicators as these action plans, if implemented, \\nwill provide higher possibility of improvement. Prioritization is based on the three criteria’s given below: \\ni. Where WEF assign highest weightage (5 Pillars i.e. Pillar 10 to 14 accounts for 50% weightage) \\nii. Areas where India’s rank is falling \\niii. Where India’s rank is already low and showcasing relatively no improvement\\nFollowing is the summary of the action plan of the 32 prioritised indicators:\\n1. Pillar 3: Health and Hygiene\\n indicator 3.01: Physician d ensity; ministry of Health and Family Welfare\\n As of now, there are 7.63 lakhs AYUSH doctors who are not recognized as general practitioners by \\nMCI/NMC. Hence, by recognizing these AYUSH doctors as medical practitioners, India can increase its overall value in this indicator from 0.7 to 1.27.\\n indicator 3.03: a ccess to improved drinking water; ministry of drinking Water and sanitation\\n Emulating Bihar State Government’s scheme of “Har Ghar nal Ka Jal ”, in other states of India which \\ncan significantly increase India’s value while ensuring safe and clean drinking water to all residents.\\n indicator 3.04: Hospital beds; ministry of Health and Family Welfare\\n At present, India is only providing the database of government hospital beds for calculation of this \\nindicator’s value. Private hospital beds’ quantity, which constitutes a large portion of the total strength, \\ngoes unaccounted. Hence, a centralized database should be developed for both government and private hospitals which can be done by following Australia’s model where it is mandatory to register a private hospital under a central database system.India Tourism Statistics, 2019 Survey/Studies1522. Pillar 4: Human r esource and Labour market\\n indicator 4.04: treatment of customers; ministry of consumer affairs, Food and Publications \\ndistribution\\n Reduction of the pendency rate of consumer dispute cases by establishing new circuit benches as \\nonly 13 circuit benches are currently operating in the country. Additionally, feedback from consumers who were victims of fraud or received improper service could be taken to analyze current loopholes in customer service provision in our country.\\n indicator 4.05: Hiring and Firing Practices; ministry of Labour & Employment\\n As per Glassdoor’s economic research study of 25 countries globally, India has the shortest reported interview time of 16.1 days on an average, which has been achieved due to flexibility in hiring and firing practices and relaxed labour market regulations. There is an exigency to sensitize responders of the Executive Opinion Survey conducted by World Economic Forum by advertising the Ministry’s \\nachievement\\n indicator 4.06: Ease of Finding skilled Employees;ministry of skill development and Entrepreneurship\\n The entire skill training program can be aligned with demands of the industries by partnering with companies to provide training under Skill India. For this purpose, companies should be considered as \\ntraining stakeholders under Skill India. \\n3. Pillar 5: ict r eadiness\\n indicator 5.04: Broadband internet subscribers; ministry of communication\\n According to WEF’s methodology, this indicator’s score depends upon number of broadband subscribers per 100 population. Therefore, Wi-Fi hotspots at tourist sites should be installed by adopting a phase wise strategy with an aim to cover all Tier-I towns in Phase 1, all Tier-II towns in Phase 2 and so on. This would significantly increase the total count of Broadband internet subscribers in India.\\n indicator 5.07: mobile network coverage; ministry of communication\\n Mobile network coverage is defined as percentage of inhabitants who are within range of a mobile cellular signal, irrespective of whether they are subscribers as stated by WEF. However, currently total penetration of towers in rural areas is only 58%. Hence, Boost Installation of telecom towers should be executed on government premises in rural areas. Additionally, incentive can be provided to Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) to encourage them to increase telecom towers in rural areas.\\n4. Pillar 6: Prioritization of t ravel and t ourism \\n indicator 6.01: Government prioritization of travel and tourism industry; ministry of t ourism\\n Post analyzing the official Incredible India’s website and mobile application, it can be concluded that both require immediate rework on their marketing strategy as they are unable to attract traffic. Both lack in providing a multi lingual feature and the website is in urgent need of search engine optimization.\\n indicator 6.02: t&t government expenditure\\n A third-party National Tourism Infrastructure Gap Assessment can be conducted to identify major India Tourism Statistics, 2019153\\nSurvey/Studiesscope of improvement at various tourist destinations and cities. This can help in prioritizing investment \\non tourism infrastructure.\\n5. Pillar 6: Prioritization of t ravel and t ourism\\n indicator 6.06: country Brand s trategy rating; ministry of t ourism\\n Subscribe to Digital Demand - D2 tool to gain access to cluster of touristic searches as it gives insights on the popularity of a tourist destination, what tourist are searching for at a destination, seasonality trend and target market. This tool would facilitate as a surveillance system in continuously measuring \\nthe impact of marketing campaign. The client list of this tool consists of national tourism organizations \\nof Sweden, Portugal, Germany, Finland, Costa Rica, Norway, European Travel Commission etc.\\n6. Pillar 7: international openness\\n indicator 7.01: Visa requirements; ministry of Home affairs\\n Extension of e-visa facility to countries/territories that are providing exemption from visa/visa on arrival/e-visa facility to Indian passport holders. Countries such as Maldives, Northern Cyprus, \\nReunion, Svalbard and Jan Mayen, British Virgin Island, Ethiopia, Togo, Niue, Guinea-Bissau are \\nproviding visa on arrival to Indian passport holders. However, passport holders of these countries are \\nstill required to follow the traditional method of acquiring visa.\\n7. Pillar 9: Environmental sustainability\\n indicator 9.03: sustainability of travel and tourism industry development;ministry of t ourism\\n Promotion of sustainable rural tourism in India by taking advantage of Globally Important Agricultural \\nHeritage sites (GIAHs) recognized by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (For example: Darjeeling System, Sikkim Himalayan Agriculture, Saffron Heritage in J&K,\\n Kottanad below sea farming in Kerala etc.) This would achieve two objectives at once: giving tourists an experience and memories to last for a lifetime and providing villagers with opportunities to improve their livelihoods.\\n indicator 9.04: Particulate matter (2.5) concentration; ministry of Environment, Forest and climate \\nchange\\n Drafting and implementation of a scheme “Clean Air Mission” on similar lines as “Swachh Bharat Abhiyan” on the national level is required to combat air pollution. This Clean Air Mission [CAMINDIA] scheme will aim to implement government policies formed specifically for air pollution mitigation across several ministries dealing with transport, power, construction, agriculture, rural development, and environment, as well as across city and state jurisdictions.\\n indicator 9.09: Wastewater treatment;ministry of Water r esources, river development and Ganga \\nrejuvenation\\n There are 746 Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in India out of which 224 STPs are either non-operational or are under maintenance. India should resurrect those 224 STPs on urgent basis so more wastewater could be treated.\\n8. Pillar 10: air t ransport infrastructure\\n indicator 10.01: Quality of air transport infrastructure;ministry of civil a viation\\n indicator 10.02: a vailable seat kilometers, domestic; ministry of civil a viationIndia Tourism Statistics, 2019 Survey/Studies154 indicator 10.03: a vailable seat kilometers, international; ministry of civil a viation\\n indicator 10.04: aircraft departures; ministry of civil a viation\\n indicator 10.05: airport density; ministry of civil a viation\\n indicator 10.06: number of operating airlines; ministry of civil a viation\\n Formation of a centrally located Maintenance, Repair and Overhauling (MRO) hub within India with \\na balanced taxation regime that could help contain the cost of maintenance of aircrafts which \\notherwise are being serviced at foreign countries like Singapore.\\n Incorporation of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) that contributes a third of a carrier’s costs within the ambit of the goods and services tax (GST) where ATF can be classified in the highest GST slab of 28 \\npercent which is 12 percent less than the current 40 percent (including both central and state levies) \\ntax on ATF. Thus, a policy intervention by GOI can create a brighter path for aviation industry.\\n9. Pillar 11: Ground and Port infrastructure\\n indicator11.01: Quality of roads; ministry of r oad t ransport & Highways\\n To improve the construction quality of national highways, QCI in collaboration with MoRTH has \\ndeveloped a framework to rate construction companies, which would be utilized during future tendering process. Similarly, a rating framework could be developed for state highways that would further improve the quality of Indian roads.\\n indicator 11.05: railroad d ensity; ministry of railways\\n As per Indian Railway’s methodology, urban rail transits (metro rail) are not considered while calculating railroad density. Hence, inclusion of growing metro rail tracks in this calculation would increase India’s rank in this indicator.\\n indicator11.06: Quality of Port infrastructure; ministry of shipping\\n Investment in infrastructure to reduce a vessel’s Turn-Around-Time (TAT) should be made. This would improve the overall performance of the ports thereby improving ports’ infrastructure quality.\\n Indicator 11.07: Ground Transport Efficiency; Ministry of Road Transport & Highways\\n Vast majority of bus users make same type of commuting trips every day but India lacks in providing interstate passes. For example, a large chunk of people travels from Chandigarh to Delhi daily. An introduction of interstate bus pass will ease the travelling of people and also reducing the cost of daily commute.\\n10. Pillar 12: t ourist service infrastructure\\n indicator 12.01: Hotel rooms; ministry of t ourism\\n According to WEF’s methodology, this indicator’s score depends upon number of hotel rooms per 100 \\npopulation. Currently there is no system in place to verify the total number of hotels in India. However, \\nevery hotel must get itself registered at the local police station. Hence, a central database depository can be maintained with the help of State Police Departments through which actual count of hotel \\nrooms can be identified\\n11. Pillar 13: natural r esources\\n indicator 13.02: t otal known species; ministry of Environment, Forest and climate changeIndia Tourism Statistics, 2019155\\nSurvey/Studies WEF consider IUCN’s database for this indicator. Upon comparing this with Zoological Survey of India \\n(ZSI’s) database, 181 species were found to be missing from India’s list in IUCN’s database. MoEF should contact IUCN to get clarification regarding the said disparity.\\n12. Pillar14: cultural r esources and Business t ravel\\n indicator: 14.02: oral and intangible cultural heritage; ministry of culture\\n UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) nomination committee give priority to elements which are registered under (i.) Urgent Safeguarding (ii.) Best Safeguarding Practice and (iii.) Multi-national \\nelements. Hence, India should focus on registering more elements that lie under above-mentioned \\npriorities as this would increase our chance to get more elements enlisted under UNESCO’s ICH list.\\n indicator:14.03: number of large sports stadiums; ministry of Youth affairs and sports\\n As per WEF’s methodology, stadiums with a capacity larger than 20,000 seats are considered. India \\nhas 42 stadiums which have seating capacity exactly equal to 20,000 and these are not considered \\nby WEF. Therefore, even increasing a single seat in these stadiums would increase India’s rank in this \\nindicator.\\n indicator:14.04: number of international associations meetings; ministry of t ourism\\n indicator:14.05 cultural and entertainment tourism digital demand; ministry of t ourism\\n Destination marketing organizations (DMOs) and region level bureaus are important for Meeting, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) tourism since they are responsible for promoting the country nationally and internationally as a business event destination. Focus should be on assisting Indian Convention Promotion Bureau (ICPB) in gaining access to International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) membership as DMO and establishing city/region level bureaus.\\nconclusion\\n1. The study has helped to decode WEF’s Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index report, 2017 based on which ranking of various countries are made. \\n2. Based on this, an action plan has been suggested. The action plan ranges from short term and easily doable to very major policy interventions needed at the highest levels. \\n3. In this process, action to be taken by various Ministry/Departments have been identified. Ministry/Departments will get sensitized to the parameters that require improvement and could lead to improved ranking of India in the various sectors. \\n4. The study has also revealed that Ministry of Tourism may need to take up the modification of some of the indicators with WEF which will benefit the ranking of India.\\n10.2 methodology for Estimation of domestic and Foreign Visitors (same day & overnight) at \\ndistrict Level in india\\ni. introduction\\nMinistry of Tourism compiles data on domestic and foreign (tourist) visits in States/ UTs based on the \\ninformation received from the State Governments/ UT Administrations. Such information at State/ UT level is generally collected by their Tourism Departments on the basis of administrative records and returns. In many cases, the information supplied does not cover the same-day visitors, visitors staying with friends and India Tourism Statistics, 2019 Survey/Studies156relatives, etc. A need was felt to prepare a standard methodology for estimation of number of visits and \\nvisitors at district level which can be executed/ used by the State Governments / UT Administrations. \\nIn accordance with the definition prescribed by the UNWTO in order to assess the Internal Tourism Volume, \\nvisits by following 8 categories of visitors need to be accounted:\\nLeisure visitor: non Leisure visitor: \\na. Same day Visitors a. Same day Visitors\\nb. Overnight Visitors b. Overnight Visitors\\ni.Staying at accommodation units i.Staying at accommodation units\\nii.Staying with friends and relatives ii.Staying with friends and relatives\\niii.Staying elsewhere (at temporary units) iii.Staying elsewhere (at temporary units)\\nThe Methodology comprises of multiple surveys in two phases (Phase I and Phase II) for collection of information from the following 3 sources:\\n(i) t ourist destinations: \\na. To assess the numbers (volume) of leisure visits by undertaking a counting exercise at the \\nentry gates / points of the destination.\\nb. To assess the average number of destinations visited / intended to be visited in the district, place of stay of leisure visitors, etc. by undertaking a short survey at destinations. If the \\ndistrict has an exceptionally important destination drawing a large no. of visitors (such as \\nTirupati in Chittoor District of Andhra Pradesh), then such a destination should be treated as a separate notional district.\\n(ii) Exit points of the district viz. railway stations, bus stands and airports: \\n To ascertain the proportion of the 8 categories of visitors mentioned above in a district by undertaking a survey at exit points. \\n(iii) a ccommodation units: \\na. To assess the total number of units & rooms by undertaking a Census and updating the list in every quarter.\\nb. To assess employee pattern and occupancy, etc. by undertaking survey at accommodation units. \\nmethodology\\nPhase i: (Preliminary phase) \\nThe main purpose of conducting Phase I is to assess the following:\\nI. To determine the important tourist destinations in a district where more than 90% of visitors to the \\ndistricts visit and accordingly to distribute the earmarked sample size of the district to canvass the \\nshort survey questionnaire in Phase II.India Tourism Statistics, 2019157\\nSurvey/StudiesII. To find out the exist points of the district and the flow of exit through the points so as to distribute the \\nsample size of canvassing the questionnaire of exit Survey of Phase II.\\nIII. Listing of accommodation units in the district.\\nThe phase would follow the given mandate:\\na. destinations:\\na. An exercise will be undertaken by the executing agency of the State Government/ UT \\nAdministration covering 14 days of a month to identify the major tourist destinations in a \\ndistrict based on the tourist traffic.\\nb. For ticketed destinations, number of visitors will be available from the number of tickets sold. \\nc. For non- ticketed destinations, manual counting of visitors entering the destination through \\nall the gates / points / approaches which provide entry will be carried out. For this purpose counting sheets would be executed.\\nd. Assessment should be done in a normal period.\\ne.

All the accommodation units (hotels, tourist lodges, dharamshalas, government/ private \\ncompanies’ guest houses, etc.) in the district will be listed through the following sources / methods:\\ni. Secondary sources like trade directories / records of registration authorities like \\nMunicipal Corporations.\\nii. Primary physical scanning. \\nb. This list will be used as a sampling frame to select units for monthly survey of accommodation \\nunits in the Phase II. This census list must be updated every quarter in the Phase II.\\nPhase ii: (main phase)\\nPhase II consists of the following main surveys.\\ni. Short Survey at destinations (sample size – 600/month/district) to distinguish visitors and \\nnon-visitors.\\nii. Accommodation Survey (Survey at accommodations units) to determine the proportion of visitors staying in the accommodation units and the employment pattern of the accommodation units etc.\\niii. Exit Survey (Sample size-400/month/district) to determine the characteristics/ profile of visitors.\\ndetails of the surveys in Phase ii are as follows:\\na. t ourist destinations:\\na. coverage:\\ni. selection of destinations: \\n The destinations for which the observed cumulative count of visits in Phase I is more \\nthan 90% of the total number of visits in the district will be surveyed in the Phase II.\\nii. coverage of important tourism event:\\n The date and week on which important tourism event is scheduled to take place at the \\nselected tourist destination will be positively covered.\\n Information about important festivals, fairs, religious events, MICE events, events organized by the Govt. etc. at the selected tourist destinations will be collected in advance for the 12-month period. \\n If the important tourist event at the selected tourist destination falls outside the selected week and dates, the nearest week/dates will be substituted by the week/dates of the special event. India Tourism Statistics, 2019159\\nSurvey/Studiesb. assessment of numbers:\\n The number (volume) of leisure visits has to be assessed at tourist destinations of a district. i. In case of ticketed destinations the number of visits has to be taken from the record \\nof sales of tickets. \\nii. In case of non – ticketed destinations, assessment of the total number of leisure visits has to be made through counting / execution of counting sheets.\\niii. An investigator needs to be deployed at each of the entry points of the destination in \\norder to manually count the number of leisure visits to the destination on the selected \\ndays / dates.\\niv. Time Slot should be specific to the destination and should cover:\\n1. The entire duration during which entry is permitted in case of ticketed / gated \\ndestination\\n2. The duration in which nearly all the visitors visits in case of a non-ticketed / ungated destination\\nc. short survey:\\n In order to obtain a brief profile of the visitors to the destination a short survey using a \\nquestionnaire comprising of 8 – 9 questions has to be carried out at tourist destinations (both ticketed as well as non – ticketed). Following are the deliverables of this survey:\\ni. Break-up of number of visitors into overnight visitors (staying at accommodation units, \\nstaying with friends and relatives, staying at other places) and the same-day visitors, separately for domestic and foreign visitors. \\nii. Average destinations visited / intended to be visited, place of stay, etc. \\niii. Assessment of quantum of visits by non – visitors and by non – leisure visitors. \\nFollowing are the particulars of this survey:\\ni. sample size of visitors at district level: \\n Statistically, a sample of size 384 is required to get estimate of a parameter with a \\nprecision of 5% points and 95% level of confidence. For the proposed survey, however, \\nthe sample size will be 600 per district per month. \\n For a district if in certain months these much samples are not available, the shortfall should be covered in next months.\\n If a particular district is not important from tourism perspective and the sample size \\nof 600 visitors per month is not likely to be available, then portion of this sample size \\nmay be allocated to other districts having larger no. of visitors. This redistribution must \\nbe done based on the findings of Phase I of the methodology. \\n At State level, the sample size of 600 x no. of Districts for the survey at Tourist Destinations has to be maintained every month. India Tourism Statistics, 2019 Survey/Studies160ii. distribution of sample size among t ourist destinations:\\n The sample of 600 has to be distributed between the destinations (ticketed and \\nnon- ticketed) of the district. This may be done in proportion to the visitors at the destinations as observed in Phase I of the methodology.\\n The sample proportion of domestic as well as foreign visitors is to be decided on the basis of their proportion observed in phase I of the survey or on the basis of data of ticket sales of previous day in case of destinations with differential tickets.\\niii. selection of days for survey of visitors in different months:\\n The survey will be conducted during all the 12 months of the year at each selected \\ndestination. In a particular month at a particular destination, survey will be done during 2 weeks.\\n In the first week, first 3 days of the week will be covered, and in the second week last \\n4 days of the week will be covered. For this purpose, first day of the month will be \\nconsidered as the first day of the week.\\n The dates of survey at a tourist destination during the 12 months will be as follows: \\nmonth Weeks days of weeks dates of the month\\nFirst First and Third 1st week: 1-3 days\\n3rd week: 4-7 days1,2,3,18,19,20,21\\nSecond Second and Fourth 2nd week: 1-3 days\\n4th week: 4-7 days8,9,10, 25,26,27,28\\nThird First and Fourth 1st week: 1-3 days\\n4th week: 4-7 days1,2,3,25,26,27,28\\nFourth Second and Third 2nd week: 1-3 days\\n3rd week: 4-7 days8,9,10,18,19,20,21\\nFifth First and Second 1st week: 1-3 days\\n2nd week: 4-7 days1,2,3,11,12,13,14\\nSixth Third and Fourth 3rd week: 1-3 days\\n4th week: 4-7 days15,16,17, 25,26,27,28\\nSeventh to Twelve Above pattern will be repeated\\niv. time slots for the survey at a destination:\\n Time slots should be such that they cover the varying visitor traffic pattern at a \\ndestination. For example, at some religious places visitors visit the destination in early morning and/ or late evening. Similarly fairs and festivals may draw large number of visitors during late hours in the evening. Time slots of the survey at each destination should be devised in a manner so as to capture the variations in visitor inflow.India Tourism Statistics, 2019161\\nSurvey/Studiesd. Exclusions:\\n Discounting visits by non-visitors at non – ticketed destinations \\n In the short survey at destinations questions are asked on usual place of residence and usual \\nenvironment. Based on responses to these questions a person can be classified as a visitor or non - visitor. No exclusions for leisure visits by non – visitors are to be done for ticketed destinations so as to avoid mismatch with data of sales of ticket.\\n In case of non – ticketed destinations, a person is classified as a non- visitor if he / she \\nbelongs to the same city / village and visits the non – ticketed destination with a frequency of \\nonce in a month or more than that. Thus the total volume obtained from the counting sheet \\nshould discount a percentage of non- visitors which is observed in the short survey.\\ne. assessing the number of visits by non – leisure visitors at all destinations.\\n In the short survey, Question is also asked on the purpose of visit to the district. Based on \\nthis the leisure visits at destinations can be classified as visits by leisure visitors and visits by \\nnon-leisure visitors.\\nf. conversion of leisure visits at destinations to leisure visitors at district level.\\n In the Short survey, Question is also asked on number of destinations visited / planned to be \\nvisited. Based on this information the number of leisure visits at destinations of a district are converted into number of leisure visitors to a district.\\n If the leisure visits by non – leisure visitors are discounted at visits stage then the number of leisure visits may undermine the popularity of the tourist destination. \\n However, if these visits are accounted in leisure part at the time of calculation of leisure visitors (at district level), then the purpose for which visitors come to the district may not be presented correctly. Moreover, this might lead to duplication while estimating the number of non -leisure visitors to the district.\\n Thus, while converting leisure visits to leisure visitors the total number (volume) obtained from the counting sheet (after discounting non – visitors in case of non-ticketed destinations) should discount a percentage of leisure visits by non- leisure visitors which is observed in the short survey. \\n For converting leisure visits to leisure visitors, average number of places visited / planned to be visited in a district should be taken from responses corresponding to only leisure visitors. \\nB. Entry/Exit Points of the district\\n The survey at the tourist destinations will provide the numbers (volume) of only leisure visitors. The non – leisure visitors cannot be counted in full, hence the methodology envisages estimation of non – leisure visitors in a district based on ratio method. \\n Thus, for having an idea about the total number of visitors in the district, information about visitors collected at tourist destinations has to be supplemented by information on the non - leisure visitors. \\na. coverage:\\n All exit points of the district have to be covered.India Tourism Statistics, 2019 Survey/Studies162b. survey:\\n Survey of the visitors (at the time of their exit) at the exit points of the district (as identified \\nin the Phase I) will provide information about the 8 categories of visitors mentioned in introductory section. It will also help in obtaining detailed profile of the visitors.\\nc. sample size:\\n This survey will be conducted with a sample size of 400 per month for each district. This \\nsample will be allocated to the major exit points according to the proportion of visitors leaving \\nthrough those exit points, as obtained from the Phase I survey. The canvassing of the schedule \\nof exit survey shall be done irrespective of the nationality of the respondent, so as to have a \\nrandom representation of both foreign and domestic visitors. \\n The sample size allocated for each month should be captured in each district.\\nd. the days on which this survey should be done are as follows:\\nWeek days\\n1 First 03 days\\n2 Last 04 days\\n3 First 03 days\\n4 Last 04 days\\n The first day of the month will be considered as the first day of the week\\nc. a ccommodation units\\na. Obtaining particulars of accommodation units for all the units:\\n A short schedule would be canvassed amongst all the accommodation units listed in Census conducted in Phase I. Apart from the identification details, particulars like number of rooms, number of beds, total number of persons employed, annual turnover, etc. would be collected.\\n This information would be collected initially, and thereafter updated every quarter along with the updating of the list of accommodation units.\\nb. Survey of Accommodation Units:\\n The census list would form the sampling frame for the monthly survey of accommodation \\nunits. \\n The accommodation units listed in Phase I will be grouped in the following categories:\\n(i) Classified hotels\\n(ii) Other accommodation units-a. Having more than 20 rooms\\nb. Having 10-20 rooms\\nc. Having less than 10 rooms India Tourism Statistics, 2019163\\nSurvey/Studies For the purpose of conducting the Accommodation Survey, all the classified hotels \\nand 10% of the units in each of the categories of other accommodation units will be selected by using circular systematic sampling method.\\n Fresh sample would be selected in each month.\\n From all the selected accommodation units, the following information about overnight visitors will be collected based on the records:\\na. Number of checked-in (domestic / foreign)\\nb. Number of room nights spent (domestic / foreign)\\nc. Residency status of the tourists (within the state / within country/ outside \\ncountry)\\nd. Purpose of their visit etc.\\n This information has to be collected in the 1st week of every month for the preceding \\nmonth.\\nEstimation of total number of visits and visitors at district level\\na. obtaining total number of leisure visits in a district\\n In case of a ticketed destination, the total number of leisure visits to the destination in a given month, \\nsay ‘M’, would be the same as the number obtained from sales of tickets. \\n In case of compilation of number of leisure visits in a month for a non-ticketed destination 2 steps are involved:\\n Suppose ‘m’ is the number of leisure visits (after discounting visits by non-visitors) at a tourist destination during survey done on 14 days. This figure would be inflated (as explained below at points 1 and 2) to arrive at a figure of total leisure visits at the respective tourist destination in the month, i.e. ‘M’. \\n1. When the month has no special tourist event\\n Suitable multiplier should be calculated for each month depending upon the number of days \\nin the month. Suppose that N is the number of leisure visits in a month of 31 days based on the survey done on 14 days, then the multiplier would be 31/14 and N*(31/14) will be the total number of leisure visits during that month. Similarly, multiplier can be calculated for the month with 30, 29 and 28 days.\\n2. When the month has special tourist event\\n For month having a special tourist event, estimation would have to be done for the period of \\nspecial tourist event separately and remaining period of the month separately. The approach \\nwould remain the same as in [1] above.\\nB.  converting Leisure visits into leisure visitors\\n The number of leisure visits, thus obtained at step ‘A’ are then required to be converted to number of leisure visitors.India Tourism Statistics, 2019 Survey/Studies164 The total leisure visits also contain leisure visits paid by non – leisure visitors also. If the leisure visits \\nby non-leisure visitors are accounted for while converting leisure visits to leisure visitors this might lead to duplication while estimating the number of non -leisure visitors to the district.\\n Thus, while converting leisure visits to leisure visitors the total volume obtained from the counting sheet (after discounting non – visitors in case of non-ticketed destinations) should discount a percentage of leisure visits by non- leisure visitors which is observed in the short survey. For converting leisure visits to leisure visitors, average number of places visited / planned to be visited in a district should be taken from responses corresponding to only leisure visitors. \\n Let ‘p’ be the proportion of leisure visits by non – leisure visitors as observed from the monthly survey at destinations. \\n The monthly sample size of survey at destinations is 600 in a district. Now, suppose out of 600, 60 were non leisure visitors. Then ‘p’ = 10% = 0.1.\\n Suppose, the monthly estimated volume of leisure visits in the District A= N = 10000. Then leisure \\nvisits by leisure visitors = 10000 * 0.9 = 9000.\\n Suppose, average number of tourist destinations visited / planned to be visited in a district by a leisure visitor = 2. This implies estimated number of leisure visitors = 9000/2 = 4500\\nc. Estimation of non-leisure visitors\\n Based on the volume of leisure visitors in the district obtained from the survey & counting at \\ndestinations and ratios of non – leisure visitors obtained from the survey at entry / exit points of the district, the volume of non – leisure visitors in the district can be obtained.\\n If following is the percentage distribution of Domestic Visitors obtained from Exit Point Survey at District A (sample size =1200 per quarter obtained by pooling results of 3 months of a quarter):\\nLeisure non Leisure\\nStaying \\nat \\nHotelsStaying \\nwith \\nFriends \\n& \\nrelativesStaying \\nelsewhereSame \\nday \\nvisitorsTotal Staying \\nat HotelsStaying \\nwith \\nFriends \\n& \\nrelativesStaying \\nelsewhereSame \\nday \\nvisitorsTotal\\n5 14 16 20 55 3 12 13 17 45\\nNow, if 4500 is the estimated number of leisure visitors in district A, then 4500 would be akin to 55%. This implies 1% visitors approximately amount to 4500/55 = 81.81== 82.\\nWe can, thus, estimate the monthly volume of different categories of non-leisure visitors in the following \\nmanner: \\n\\uf0d8 Non Leisure visitors staying at hotels = 82*3=246.\\n\\uf0d8 Non Leisure visitors staying with friends and relatives = 82 *12=984.\\n\\uf0d8 Total Non-Leisure visitors = 82 *45=3690. \\n\\uf0d8 Total visitors in District for the given month = 4500 + 3690 = 8190.India Tourism Statistics, 2019165\\nSurvey/Studiesd. Estimation of monthly volume of visits in a district\\n In case of non – leisure, one visitor can be said to pay one visit at district level for its non-leisure \\npurpose. Any visit to a tourist destination is already accounted for in leisure visits, these are visits for leisure purposes.\\n Thus, total number of monthly visits at district level, say V, can be obtained by clubbing leisure visits and non – leisure visits.\\n V = 10000+3690 = 13690.\\nE. Estimation for post survey periods\\n As the monthly data of visitors will be required by the State/ UT Governments in future also the \\noutcome of this survey will be utilized in the following manner by the State/ UT Governments.\\n Post survey, the list of accommodation units in the selected tourist destinations in the States/UTs \\nmay be updated on a regular basis by the State/ UT Governments. The information about distribution \\nof various categories of visitors obtained from the current survey will be appropriately combined with \\nthe information on number of visitors staying in accommodation units to estimate the number of \\nother categories as well as total number of visitors in the district in subsequent periods.\\n******\\nNote: Detailed Methodology along with format of various Questionnaires and concepts/definitions are available on the link \\nhttp://tourism.gov.in/sites/default/files/Other/State%20Tourism%20Survey.pdf11\\ncHaPtEr\\nFinanciaL assistancE Pro VidEd BY t ourism FinancE corPoration o F indiaAtithidevo BhavaIndia Tourism Statistics, 2019169\\nFinancial Assistance Provided by Tourism Finance Corporation of India11.1  Tourism Finance Corporation of India (TFCI), since its inception in 1989, has been providing financial \\nassistance to enterprises, for setting up and/ or development of tourism related activities, facilities and \\nservices, which inter-alia include hotels, restaurants, holiday resorts, amusement parks and complexes for entertainment, education and sports, safari parks, cultural centres, convention halls, all forms of transport industry, ropeways, travel and tour operating agencies, tourism emporia, sports facilities etc. TFCI provides all forms of financial assistance for new, expansion, diversification/ modernisation projects in tourism industry and related activities, facilities and services in addition to imparting high quality Research & Consultancy services to the tourism industry in general and to the investors in tourism industry in particular.
